VPN and Network configuration

 exec_always nm-applet --indicator
 
Needs to be with the --indicator for it to show up. Also this supports the SAML vpn stuff as it's using the patched NetworkManager-openconnect! 


# JUST IN CASE

DNS issues have been fixed. When I tested with the Cisco anyconnect CLI client for Linux, it connected, but injected a global internal nvidia DNS settings which remained after I disconnected. Which make further DNS attempts to nvidia fail. Clearing DNS caches didn't help, but running `sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved.service` reset the global info.
